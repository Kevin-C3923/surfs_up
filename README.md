- Both June and December average temperature around the low to mid 70's, June 74.94 degrees and December 71.04 degrees. 

- Both months average and the 50% bins are almost the same

- June's min temperature is 64 degrees with 25% bins being at 73 degrees, while December's min temperature is 56 degrees with the 25% bins being at 69 degrees.

### Summary

With the results of these analysis we are able to determine that the temperature for June would be alright for running a surf and ice cream shop. However, temperature for December may cause a hindrance if the temperature leans more towards the lower end.

More information will be needed to determine if this business is sustainable year round. To get more information, another query that can be writen would search the wind speed for both months, as wind has a major factor in creating waves. It needs be windy enought to generates waves but not to strong so that we can still sell ice cream. 

Another query that will be needed is to get the information about rain, as just raining would stop business. It would be beneficial to determine how two months that are completely different from each other fairs
